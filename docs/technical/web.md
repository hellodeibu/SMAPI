and update check API.

## Overview
The `SMAPI.Web` project provides an API and web UI hosted at `*.smapi.io`.

### Log parser
The log parser provides a web UI for uploading, parsing, and sharing SMAPI logs. The logs are
persisted in a compressed form to Pastebin.

The log parser lives at https://log.smapi.io.

### Web API
SMAPI provides a web API at `api.smapi.io` for use by SMAPI and external tools. The URL includes a
`{version}` token, which is the SMAPI version for backwards compatibility. This API is publicly
accessible but not officially released; it may change at any time.

The API has one `/mods` endpoint. This provides mod info, including official versions and URLs
(from Chucklefish, GitHub, or Nexus), unofficial versions from the wiki, and optional mod metadata
from the wiki and SMAPI's internal data. This is used by SMAPI to perform update checks, and by
external tools to fetch mod data.

The API accepts a `POST` request with the mods to match, each of which **must** specify an ID and
may _optionally_ specify [update keys](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest#Update_checks).
The API will automatically try to fetch known update keys from the wiki and internal data based on
the given ID.

```
POST https://api.smapi.io/v2.0/mods
{
   "mods": [
      {
         "id": "Pathoschild.LookupAnything",
         "updateKeys": [ "nexus:541", "chucklefish:4250" ]
      }
   ],
   "includeExtendedMetadata": true
}
```

The API will automatically aggregate versions and errors. Each mod will include...
* an `id` (matching what you passed in);
* up to three versions: `main` (e.g. 'latest version' field on Nexus), `optional` if newer (e.g.
  optional files on Nexus), and `unofficial` if newer (from the wiki);
* `metadata` with mod info crossreferenced from the wiki and internal data (only if you specified
  `includeExtendedMetadata: true`);
* and `errors` containing any error messages that occurred while fetching data.

For example:
```
[
   {
      "id": "Pathoschild.LookupAnything",
      "main": {
         "version": "1.19",
         "url": "https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541"
      },
      "metadata": {
         "id": [
            "Pathoschild.LookupAnything",
            "LookupAnything"
         ],
         "name": "Lookup Anything",
         "nexusID": 541,
         "gitHubRepo": "Pathoschild/StardewMods",
         "compatibilityStatus": "Ok",
         "compatibilitySummary": "âœ“ use latest version."
      },
      "errors": []
   }
]
```

## For SMAPI developers
### Local environment
A local environment lets you run a complete copy of the web project (including cache database) on
your machine, with no external dependencies aside from the actual mod sites.

Initial setup:

1. [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) and add its
   `bin` folder to the system PATH.
2. Create a local folder for the MongoDB data (e.g. `C:\dev\smapi-cache`).
3. Enter your credentials in the `appsettings.Development.json` file. You can leave the MongoDB
   credentials as-is to use the default local instance; see the next section for the other settings.

To launch the environment:
1. Launch MongoDB from a terminal (change the data path if applicable):
    ```sh
    mongod --dbpath C:\dev\smapi-cache
    ```
2. Launch `SMAPI.Web` from Visual Studio to run a local version of the site.  
    <small>(Local URLs will use HTTP instead of HTTPS, and subdomains will become routes, like
    `log.smapi.io` &rarr; `localhost:59482/log`.)</small>

### Production environment
A production environment includes the web servers and cache database hosted online for public
access. This section assumes you're creating a new production environment from scratch (not using
the official live environment).

Initial setup:

1. Launch an empty MongoDB server (e.g. using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).
2. Create an AWS Beanstalk .NET environment with these environment properties:

   property name                   | description
   ------------------------------- | -----------------
   `LogParser:PastebinDevKey`      | The [Pastebin developer key](https://pastebin.com/api#1) used to authenticate with the Pastebin API.
   `LogParser:PastebinUserKey`     | The [Pastebin user key](https://pastebin.com/api#8) used to authenticate with the Pastebin API. Can be left blank to post anonymously.
   `LogParser:SectionUrl`          | The root URL of the log page, like `https://log.smapi.io/`.
   `ModUpdateCheck:GitHubPassword` | The password with which to authenticate to GitHub when fetching release info.
   `ModUpdateCheck:GitHubUsername` | The username with which to authenticate to GitHub when fetching release info.
   `MongoDB:Host`                  | The hostname for the MongoDB instance.
   `MongoDB:Username`              | The login username for the MongoDB instance.
   `MongoDB:Password`              | The login password for the MongoDB instance.
   `MongoDB:Database`              | The database name (e.g. `smapi` in production or `smapi-edge` in testing environments).

To deploy updates:
1. Deploy the web project using [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/).
2. If the MongoDB schema changed, delete the MongoDB database. (It'll be recreated automatically.)
